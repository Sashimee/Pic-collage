/**

 * The app has exactly one Konva stage — the live board — and `exportBoard`
 * snapshots it. A photo book needs every page, so this mounts a second stage
 * off-screen and draws each page through `BoardScene`, the same component the
 * editor uses. Nothing here touches the live document: no page switching, no
 * writes to IndexedDB, no undo history cleared.
 *
 * Pages are rendered one at a time on purpose. `rehydratePhotos` mints three
 * object URLs per photo and an A4 page at 300 DPI is a ~35 MB canvas, so
 * holding a whole book at once is how this becomes a crash on a phone.
