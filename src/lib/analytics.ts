/**
 * Anonymous usage counting via GoatCounter.
 *
 * The app's whole pitch is that photos never leave the device, so this is
 * deliberately the thinnest thing that can answer "did anyone show up, and did
 * they actually finish a collage": no cookies, no identifiers, no personal
 * data — GoatCounter records a path, a country and a referrer, and nothing that
 * could be tied back to a person. That is also why no consent banner is needed.
 *
 * Hard rule: **this module must never throw and never block the editor.** Every
 * entry point is wrapped, and a blocked or failed script is a silent no-op.
